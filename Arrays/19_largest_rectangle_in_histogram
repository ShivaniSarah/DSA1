Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height
where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
