Binary Tree Representation

You are given an array nodes.
It contains 7 integers, which represents the value of nodes of the binary tree in level order traversal.
You are also given a root of the tree which has a value equal to nodes[0].

Your task to construct a binary tree by creating nodes for the remaining 6 nodes.

Input: 
nodes = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
Output: 
         1
       /   \
     2       3
   /  \     /  \
   4  5    6   7
Explanation: 
The 7 node binary tree is represented above.

# java

class Solution{
    
    public static Node f(int idx,ArrayList<Integer> v){
        if(idx >= v.size()) return null ;
        Node root = new Node(v.get(idx));
        root.left = f(2*idx+1, v);
        root.right = f(2*idx+2, v);
        
        return root;
        
    }
    public static void createTree(Node root0, ArrayList<Integer> v ){
        // Code here
        
        root0.left = f(1, v);
        root0.right = f(2,v);
        
        
    }
}
