Geek is a software engineer. He is assigned with the task of calculating average waiting time of all the processes by following shortest job first policy.

The shortest job first (SJF) or shortest job next, is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next.

Given an array of integers bt of size n. Array bt denotes the burst time of each process. Calculate the average waiting time of all the processes and return the nearest integer which is smaller or equal to the output.

Note: Consider all process are available at time 0.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
bt = [4,3,7,1,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: After sorting burst times by shortest job policy, calculated average waiting time is 4.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
arr = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: After sorting burst times by shortest job policy, calculated average waiting time is 2.

# java

class Solution {
    static int solve(int jobs[] ) {
    // Sort the jobs in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(jobs);

        // Initialize total waiting time
        float waitTime = 0;
        // Initialize total time taken
        int totalTime = 0;
        // Get the number of jobs
        int n = jobs.length;

        // Iterate through each job
        // to calculate waiting time
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {

            // Add current total
            // time to waiting time
            waitTime += totalTime;

            // Add current job's
            // time to total time
            totalTime += jobs[i];
        }

        // Return the average waiting time
        return (int)waitTime / n;

  }
}
