https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertion-steps-to-make-a-string-palindrome/

Given a string s. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.
Return the minimum number of steps to make s palindrome.
A Palindrome String is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

Example 1:
Input: s = "zzazz"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we do not need any insertions.

Example 2:
Input: s = "mbadm"
Output: 2
Explanation: String can be "mbdadbm" or "mdbabdm".

Example 3:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 5
Explanation: Inserting 5 characters the string becomes "leetcodocteel".
