Count total set bits

Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 35.77%Submissions: 172K+Points: 4
You are given a number N. Find the total count of set bits for all numbers from 1 to N(both inclusive).

Example 1:
Input: N = 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
For numbers from 1 to 4.
For 1: 0 0 1 = 1 set bits
For 2: 0 1 0 = 1 set bits
For 3: 0 1 1 = 2 set bits
For 4: 1 0 0 = 1 set bits
Therefore, the total set bits is 5.

Example 2:
Input: N = 17
Output: 35
Explanation: From numbers 1 to 17(both inclusive), 
the total number of set bits is 35.

class Solution {
    // Function to return sum of count of set bits in the integers from 1 to n.
    public static int countSetBits(int n) {
        // Base case
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        // Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n
        int x = largestPowerOf2(n);
        
        // Total set bits in numbers from 1 to 2^x - 1
        int setBitsUpTo2x = x * (1 << (x - 1));
        
        // Set bits in the most significant bit from 2^x to n
        int msbFrom2xToN = n - (1 << x) + 1;
        
        // Remaining set bits from 1 to (n - 2^x)
        int remainingSetBits = countSetBits(n - (1 << x));
        
        return setBitsUpTo2x + msbFrom2xToN + remainingSetBits;
    }
    
    // Helper function to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n
    private static int largestPowerOf2(int n) {
        int x = 0;
        while ((1 << x) <= n) {
            x++;
        }
        return x - 1;
    }
}
