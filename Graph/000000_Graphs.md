A. Undirected Graph:

A.1. Single source Cyclic +1 Unit weights => BFS

A.2. Single source (+)ve weighted & (+)ve weighted cyclic => Dijikstra Algo

A.3. Single source (+/-)ve weighted & detects (return -1) (-)ve weighted cycle => Bellman Ford Algo

A.4. Multi source (+/-)ve weighted & detects (return -1) (-)ve weighted cycle => Floyd Warshall Algo

B. Directed Graph:

B.1. Single source (+/-) weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) => TopoSort

B.2. Single source (+)ve weighted & (+)ve weighted cyclic => Dijikstra Algo

B.3. Single source (+/-)ve weighted & detects (return -1) (-)ve weighted cycle => Bellman Ford Algo

B.4. Multi source (+/-)ve weighted & detects (return -1) (-)ve weighted cycle => Floyd Warshall Algo

Minimum Spanning Tree : 
A spanning tree is a tree in which we have N nodes(i.e. All the nodes present in the original graph) and N-1 edges and all nodes are reachable from each other.
Among all possible spanning trees of a graph, the minimum spanning tree is the one for which the sum of all the edge weights is the minimum.
There may exist multiple minimum spanning trees for a graph like a graph may have multiple spanning trees.
There are a couple of algorithms that help us to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. One is Prim’s algorithm and the other is Kruskal’s algorithm.
