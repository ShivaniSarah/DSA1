# Busy Life
# return max events that can be attended given the start and end time of each events.
# few test cases will not will need priority queue
# link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/submissions/

You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.
You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. You can only attend one event at any time d.
Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
One way to attend them all is as shown.
Attend the first event on day 1.
Attend the second event on day 2.
Attend the third event on day 3.
Example 2:

Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
Output: 4

# java

class Solution {
    public int maxEvents(int[][] events) {
        // Sort events by their start day
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int maxEvents = 0;
        int day = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int n = events.length;

        while (i < n || !minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            // Add all events starting today or earlier to the min-heap
            while (i < n && events[i][0] <= day) {
                minHeap.add(events[i][1]);
                i++;
            }
            // Remove all events that have already ended before today
            while (!minHeap.isEmpty() && minHeap.peek() < day) {
                minHeap.poll();
            }
            // If we have events in the heap, attend the one that ends the earliest
            if (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
                minHeap.poll(); // Attend the event
                maxEvents++;
            }
            // Move to the next day
            day++;
        }

# Approach I: Greedy

# Example usage
solution = Solution()
events = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [2, 3], [3, 5]]
print(solution.maxEvents(events))  # Output depends on the input events list


# Approach II: Using Priority Queue

import heapq

class Solution:
    def maxEvents(self, events: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        # Sort the events in increasing order of their start times
        events.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

        count = 0   # Keeps track of how many events we have attended until today
        today = 1   # Current day of the Event Fest [1 .. 100000]

        # Keeps track of currently live events.
        # These contained events may have started earlier, but are still "live" and unattended: all event_end_time >= today
        pq = []

        index = 0        # We'd look at the sorted events one by one
        while pq or index < len(events):
            
            # If there's no event on the current day, skip to the next event's start day
            # Earliest event to start next is events[index] as array is sorted by start time
            if not pq:
                today = events[index][0]

            # The Priority Queue already contains events started before today, and still running
            # We pull in more events from the array which are starting today
            while index < len(events) and events[index][0] == today:
                heapq.heappush(pq, events[index][1])
                index += 1

            # Here we have a simplified version of the problem as we can assume all events in the PriorityQueue have started today
            # If all events started on the same day, we would first attend the event which ends first
            heapq.heappop(pq)
            today += 1
            count += 1

            # It was a fun event yesterday, if there were multiple events ending yesterday, we could've attended just one
            while pq and pq[0] < today:
                heapq.heappop(pq)

        return count
