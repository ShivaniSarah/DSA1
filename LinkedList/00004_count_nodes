Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Examples :

Input: LinkedList : 1->2->3->4->5

Output: 5
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 5, which is its length.
Input: LinkedList : 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
 
Output: 7
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 7. Hence, the output is 7.

# java

/*Complete the function below*/
/*
class Node{
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node(int a){  data = a; next = null; }
}*/

class Solution {
    // Function to count nodes of a linked list.
    public int getCount(Node head) {
        int c=1;
        while(head.next!=null){
            c++;
            head=head.next;
        }
   return c;         
    }
}
