Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

# java

class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int x = 0;
        
        for (char i : s.toCharArray())
            x = x ^ i;
        
        for (char i : t.toCharArray())
            x = x ^ i;
        
        return (char) x;
    }
}
